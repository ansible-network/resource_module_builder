            of the normalized-vid. tag '1' represents outer most tag, tag '2' next outer most, etc. Note that the normalized-vid is used in conjunction
            with an ingress-l2-transform of the same flow-point. That is, an ingress-l2-xform operation of push/stamp is generally used to ensure
            that the frame contains the normalized-vid in flow-point to EVPN service-tunnel direction. In the case of the ingress-l2-transform
            stamp operation; - ingress-l2-transform stamp tag 1 (outer) matches normalized-vid tag 1 (outer). - ingress-l2-transform stamp tag
            2 (next outer) matches normalized-vid tag 2 (next outer (aka inner)). In the case of the ingress-l2-transform push operation; - ingress-l2-transform
            push tag 1 (outer most) matches normalized-vid tag 1 (outer), when 1 tag is being pushed via the ingress-l2-transform. - ingress-l2-transform
            push tag 2 (next outer most) matches normalized-vid tag 1 (outer), when 2 tags are being pushed via the ingress-l2-transform. - ingress-l2-transform
            push tag 1 (outer most) matches normalized-vid tag 2 (next outer (aka inner)), when 2 tags are being pushed via the ingress-l2-transform.
