          description: This object indicates the flow point identifier. The identifier is a text string that is used to identify a flow point.
            Unique string values are chosen to uniquely identify the flow point. Octet values of 0x00 through 0x1f are illegal. MEF 26.1 restricts
            the maximum size identifiers to 45 octets.

        normalized_vid:
          description: Used to represent normalized-vid values for EVPN FXC, e.g. MPLS label + vid lookup. The tag number represents the position
            of the normalized-vid. tag '1' represents outer most tag, tag '2' next outer most, etc. Note that the normalized-vid is used in conjunction
            with an ingress-l2-transform of the same flow-point. That is, an ingress-l2-xform operation of push/stamp is generally used to ensure
            that the frame contains the normalized-vid in flow-point to EVPN service-tunnel direction. In the case of the ingress-l2-transform
            stamp operation; - ingress-l2-transform stamp tag 1 (outer) matches normalized-vid tag 1 (outer). - ingress-l2-transform stamp tag
            2 (next outer) matches normalized-vid tag 2 (next outer (aka inner)). In the case of the ingress-l2-transform push operation; - ingress-l2-transform
            push tag 1 (outer most) matches normalized-vid tag 1 (outer), when 1 tag is being pushed via the ingress-l2-transform. - ingress-l2-transform
            push tag 2 (next outer most) matches normalized-vid tag 1 (outer), when 2 tags are being pushed via the ingress-l2-transform. - ingress-l2-transform
            push tag 1 (outer most) matches normalized-vid tag 2 (next outer (aka inner)), when 2 tags are being pushed via the ingress-l2-transform.
