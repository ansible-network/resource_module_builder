##  Resource module builder for Ciena

### Overview
Waveserver Ai and SAOS models

### Resource Module Builder

The modules in this project were built using the resource module builder.

Usage:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash

ansible-playbook -e rm_dest=output \
                 -e structure=collection \
                 -e collection_org=ciena \
                 -e collection_name=waveserverai \
                 -e model=models/waveserverai/xcvrs/waveserverai_xcvrs.yml \
                 -e transport=netconf \
                 site.yml
```


### Developer Notes

The tests rely on a role generated by the resource module builder. After changes to the resource module builder, the role should be regenerated and the tests modified and run as needed.  To generate the role after changes:

```
rm -rf rmb_tests/roles/my_role
ansible-playbook -e rm_dest=./rmb_tests/roles/my_role \
                 -e structure=role \
                 -e model=models/myos/interfaces/myos_interfaces.yml \
                 site.yml
```
